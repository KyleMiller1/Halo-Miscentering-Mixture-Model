# Halo-Miscentering-Mixture-Model
A Gaussian mixture model for estimating halo miscentering parameters, f<sub>mis</sub> and Ïƒ<sub>R</sub> (the fraction of miscentered halos and average amplitude of miscentering, respectively), from a collection of miscentered radial halo profiles. The fitting is performed via Bayesian inference, using PyMultiNest.
